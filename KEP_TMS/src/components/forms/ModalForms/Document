Subject: Sent Follow Up Email for Approval Training Request

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on the approval request I submitted for the training program. I understand that it may take some time for the approval process to be completed, but I wanted to make sure that you are aware of the status of my request.

I have attached a copy of the email that I sent to the approval team, in case you need to refer to it. I have also included a brief summary of the training program and the reasons why I believe it is important for our team.
